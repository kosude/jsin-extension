# jSin: your average JavaScript injector - version 2.0

[![MIT Licence](https://img.shields.io/github/license/kosude/jsin-extension-2)](./LICENCE)

jSin (or JSIN; **J**ava**S**cript **IN**jector) *[pronounced jay-sin]* is a simple, free-and-open-source JavaScript injector extension.
It aims to be as simple and minimal as possible.

## jSin will not be published on the Chrome Web Store

To publish extensions to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), you need to register as a
"Chrome Web Store Developer". This requires developers to be of a certain age (probably 18), which is fine. However, I would need to
give Google my ID in order to verify my age, which is never gonna happen:

(By the way, my Google account is set to have a birthdate in 2000, so this shouldn't be a problem anyway)

| The Firefox equivalent does not seem to need this information, so the extension will hopefully be put on there when it is in a somewhat complete state. |
