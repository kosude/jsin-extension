# jSin: your average JavaScript injector

[![MIT Licence](https://img.shields.io/github/license/kosude/jsin-extension-2)](./LICENCE)

jSin (or JSIN; **J**ava**S**cript **IN**jector) is a simple, free-and-open-source JavaScript injector extension.
It aims to be as simple and minimal as possible.

## Manifest V3 and jSin on Chrome

Since Google's [Manifest V3 rubbish](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) is gonna be forced on everyone soon,
I've been trying to find ways to hack jSin to work around the rules that Google came out with. Unfortunately, Google really fucked everyone
over with this thing, and that includes this project, which, as far as I can tell, is now impossible to maintain on Chrome.

Basically, it would require having scripts stored locally on your computer which is idiotic and kind of defeats the point when you could
make a tool to inject those in minutes. Not to mention the fact that getting such an extension working on browsers without DevTools access
(for instance in some schools and workplaces) is out of the question.

Say you use Chrome, and you want to use this extension - as far as I can tell, you have three options:
 - Waste hours of your life trying to find a workaround for this (pls contribute if you do this uwu)
 - Wait for someone who's actually smart unlike me to find a hack
 - Uninstall Chrome and download a respectable browser instead. In other words, [get Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
 
 The day that Mozilla implements Manifest V3 into Firefox will be the day this project is made completely useless, and I will probably
 archive it or something.
